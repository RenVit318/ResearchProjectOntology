# Research Project Ontology

This repository contains the source code for an ontology dedicated to describing a research project. This should include, but is not limited to: the research questions and -objectives, literature reviews and relevant publications. 

The goal of this project is to eventually track progress of my own PhD project (and to be used by others to track their progress).
